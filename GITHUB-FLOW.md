# GitHub Flow

<div align="justify">

GitHub Flow is an ideal workflow for teams that deploy frequently and want to iterate quickly without the overhead of long release cycles or complex branching strategies. It keeps the process simple and fast, enabling continuous integration and deployment, which helps catch issues early and deliver features to users rapidly.

These are the basic rules of the workflow:
1. **`main` is always deployable**

  The `main` branch must be stable and ready to deploy at all times. Never push untested or broken code.

2. **Create descriptively named branches from `main`**

  Start every new feature, fix, or idea in a new branch based on `main`, with clear and meaningful names.

3. **Push to your branch often**

  Push work regularly to the remote to back it up, share progress, and trigger CI.

4. **Open a Pull Request early**

  Use pull requests for code review, discussion, or help‚Äîlong before the branch is ‚Äúdone.‚Äù

5. **Get reviewed and approved before merging**

  Don‚Äôt merge until someone reviews and approves your work (even with just a üëç or `:shipit:`).

6. **Deploy right after merging to `main`**

  Once merged, deploy immediately or soon‚Äîeverything in `main` should be safe and shippable.

This flow emphasizes **simplicity, speed, and collaboration**, especially for teams that deploy frequently.

Welcome to gfw-commonâ€™s documentation!
======================================

The **gfw-common** package provides shared utilities and abstractions used across
Global Fishing Watch (GFW) projects. It is designed as a lightweight library of
reusable components that simplify working with data pipelines, command-line
interfaces, and integrations with external systems.

This package follows a **"common code, single source"** principle: functionality
that is used by more than one service is factored into gfw-common, ensuring
consistency, easier maintenance, and reduced duplication.
